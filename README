The *mongo-util* project is a Java library that adds a simple layer of abstraction between your business logic and the Mongo storage details.

Configure a connection to your Mongo database (or cluster), and define all the collections you want to use. (MongoDatabaseConnector and MongoCollection are your friends here, intended to be configured using Spring.)

Implement MongoDao/AbstractMongoDao to build your data-access classes, and extend the ModelFactory for each type you're storing (each MongoCollection should have its own type that extends MongoModel).
